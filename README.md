# Advanced Flutter - Clean Architecture & TDD Practice

This repository contains my learning journey through the [Advanced Flutter Course: Clean Architecture & TDD](https://hotmart.com/pt-br/marketplace/produtos/flutter-avancado-com-clean-architecture-e-tdd/F89451665S). The goal is to level up my Flutter skills and apply best practices to build scalable, testable, and maintainable mobile apps.

## ðŸš€ What I'm Learning

- **Modern Software Architecture**  
  Applying **Clean Architecture** with clear layer separation, low coupling, and high cohesion.

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**  
  Building features driven by tests: unit, integration, and widget tests with real coverage.

- **SOLID Principles & Best Practices**  
  Writing flexible, testable, and long-lasting code.

- **Caching Strategies**  
  Implementing professional local persistence techniques.

- **Design Patterns**  
  Practical usage of patterns like **Factory**, **Adapter**, **Composite**, **Decorator**, and more.

- **Advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
  Mastering concepts like inheritance, composition, immutability, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

- **API Integrations**  
  Handling data fetching and communication with external services.

- **Advanced Flutter & Dart**  
  Going beyond the basics to write clean and efficient Dart and Flutter code.
